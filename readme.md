[The Dragon Curve](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dragon_curve) is a curve formed by repeatedly replacing each line sigment by two line segments with a right angle and a rotation of 45 degrees

The juptyer notebook in the repo uses PyTorch to accelerate the construction of the fractal by using the GPU
